Thoughts
========

Just some general design thoughts, ideas, and goals. May split this into different files if the thoughts become concrete


Inspiration
-----------

Taking some design cues (both architecture, and interface) from these sites

* http://stackoverflow.com
* http://vimeo.com/forums
* http://vanillaforums.org/discussions/

Vimeo strongly influenced the look and feel of the current website, I'm moving towards the other two from a technical point of view.


Ideas
-----

Bunch of ideas about each individual page / section / feature


### Shoutbox

Same as before. Figure out how to do long polling and ajax later. Maybe even remove it totally - it does take a lot of space for not much utility...


### Polls

Keep the same. One poll per thread. maybe extend later.


### Posting in general

Use the WYSIWYG editor (punymce is best, including auto conversion of smileys) - and just have it submit raw HTML.

Then use perl to parse the submitted HTML, and convert to markdown for storage. We do this so markup is consistent across browsers. If we stored the raw HTML submitted, then a firefox user viewing a post made by a safari user won't have the font sizes correct (safari user --webkit prefix that firefox doesn't parse)

Check out: HTML::WikiConverter::Markdown Will need to extend to support all the functionality of markdown. Or write a HTML->BBCode plugin that way.

If this fails, stick with markitup, and forget all this WYSIWYG shit.


### Email

Need email functionality as a priority. Specifically forgot password link.

Notifications of new posts can wait. Lived without it for a year already...


### Nudging

Same as facebook poke. Just called a nudge. Accessed from the profile, just a button. Shows in header somewhere... Very low priority


### Private Messages

Renamed as confab - stupid word, but the only synonym of conversation that was short. Specifically means informal chat.

No inbox and sent messages, no subjects. Messages are just conversations with one individual. No broadcasting to multiple people. The inbox view is just a list of usernames, clicking on it takes you to the conversation with them. It's ordered same as normal threads.


### Locked / Sticky Flags

We should re-implement these as tags, same as the board has become a tag. It's the same principle, a deleted thread has two tags - the board, and the deleted tag.

Since messages aren't tagged (way to enterprisey, could never finish this) - we still have to have a deleted flag on messages. For the moment

We also have a locked flag on tags - so we can lock all tags in a board.


### Tags in general

Tags replace boards, we can tag to multiple boards, and it's just nice. Keep a tag "type", including a type of "standard" for direct board replacements, "ad-hoc" for user created (future), "gallery" for photo galleries, and "blog" for blog type.


### Future Plans

I would like a basic blogging platform / CMS included - To manage planet-sound. Perhaps give users an individual blog - perhaps just pull from twitter / facebook / last.fm / etc automatically for the time being.

How to store the CMS stuff - should the blog just be a tag? makes sense - automatically gives us archives. Only problem is the theming. Can work around this with the host used to access the route - show a different template based on the host used to access the route.

Plan is to have one DB for all my sites. Ideally one code base too, just with different templates. Don't want to fork for every site I manage... What about having a "pages" table, for the CMS'y functions of the site?

Why is CMS included as part of this? Wouldn't it be better to have a GIT backed, totally separate app for it? Yes and no. I'd have to create a user auth/auth system (rely on open-id? - fuckoff) - A different app accessing my DB directly? a recipe for disaster... One app for sure.

Auto attach any images that are pasted into a message, like facebook.


### Categories

Reason why we wanted hierarchical routes in the first place, as to enable us to take a thread and find out what board / category is in to check access permissions. Since we applied access permissions on a category level we needed to find this out.

I propose we apply permissions on the tag level (board) - and categories become just tag-groups. When editing permissions a tag-group just applies the permissions to all the boards contained in it individually.


### List of Boards

Eliminate the board list - as accessed by the /forum route - no-one uses it, just a waste of space. Front page now shows same info.


### Attachments

Add possibility for multiple attachments - separate DB table containing attachments.

Store attachments in subdirectories - we don't want to bump up against the max-files in a directory limit... Structure like this
/uploads/:thread-id/:message-id-:attachment-id.format - Gives lots more metadata in the image, helpful for the gallery and other places

Show attachments in the gallery - how would this work though? clicking photo, should this take you to the thread? Think on it some.

Use http://valums.com/ajax-upload/ - for the uploader instead of flash.


### Gallery

Galleries should be done as a special tag type, storing all data in standard places. Otherwise, no change. Correct redirection will be based on tag type and route used to access image.


### Archive Pages

Eliminate the route. It's all stored in the same DB table, so no performance benefit from separating them out at the front-end
All archive boards become regular tags, with the lock flag added to it.


### Private Boards

Move out of the admin centre, back on the front page - just as a tag. Perhaps investigate some way for them to show as sticky on the list until you've read them? perhaps a number next to the tag showing unread messages?


### Searching

GET searching is possible, but time limited. Searching by POST saves the results of that search to a saved-search table, with a join table containing the thread-id/message-ids of all matching messages. Make sure we show the date at the top of these saved searches, with a link to re-run the search with current data. Do this searching later on

Gallery searching is useless.


### Front Page

Should be a list of all recent threads, which is now two columns wide, and each thread is two rows high, and has the most recent posters avatar next to it, with post info (number of replies, last post date) below it. The whole row is a clickable target and takes you to the latest post in the thread that you have read.

Remove the "news" module - never ever used, a total waste of valuable space. Keep the tag, and look into making news posts stick at the top of the recent posts list until read - low priority.

Add new module that shows all tags. Not a 2006 style tag cloud - just a list of tags in a little box thing (stackoverflow) - future times we can have an option to show/hide specific tags. Also show the number of unread threads in that tag.

Module list on front page:

* Recent Posts (top left, two wide - perhaps with no heading? mockup needed)
* Users online (top right)
* Tag list (second top right - links to individual boards)
* Recent Pictures (include attachments?)
* Birthdays
* Statistics
