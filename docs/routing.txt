Routing
=======

A few ideas on how to format the routes for a community system in a consistent, logical fashion.


Requirements
------------

I would like SEO friendly urls, which mean no query strings, words that contain meaning, and a logical structure to the url - so search engines can extract meaning from the plain url

This will also enable me to have a guessable url structure, which enables manual URL manipulation.


Problems
--------

No query strings mean things like page number has to be a resource in a RESTful app - however, with a hierarchical structure one has to remove the page resource when going to a sub-item - else you would go to the page on the sub-resource.

Have to use names of resources, instead of numeric id's in URLs in order to remain SEO friendly. With thread titles, this is a problem as they are not guaranteed to be unique

Too many clicks to get around the forum, lots of pages are rarely used.


Solutions
---------

It is not possible to have a hierarchical structure with no query strings, so we use a flat tag structure. Side effect is that threads can be tagged to multiple forums - a useful feature (think stackoverflow)

to keep SEO friendly URLs, we pass the :thread-id and a new field :url-slug separated by dashes. A standard solution.

We eliminate the /forum route and the list of boards - it is rarely used, and contains no useful information. Since we are no longer hierarchical it makes little sense. Redirect to the front page.

Front page now has an expanded list of recently posted threads - up to around 20 - this is the main interface to the forum. One click from front page to the thread, this is how most people use the forum anyway.

We eliminate the /archive route, it provides no performance benefit as the data is all in the same database table, it is just showing the same data under a different route.


Technical
---------

/tagged/:tag+:tag/:page
/thread/:thread-id-:url-slug/:page

/inbox/:page
/conflab/:user-name/:page

/gallery/:tag+:tag/:page
/photo/:photo-id-:url-slug/:page

/shoutbox/:page

/userlist/:page
/profile/:user-name
